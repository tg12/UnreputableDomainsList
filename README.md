# This list contains “Untrustworthy domains” In the sense that they are either….

- Misconfigured domains
- Junk domains
- Not a TLD
- “fresh” domains, Appeared on the internet in the last 24 hours. There are bound to be the odd instance of legit domains in here but they could be...
- Throwaway domains
- Generally look “spammy”
- Domain squatters
- People looking to capitalize on domain typos
- Cryptominers, SSL Proxies, Bad IP's, Bad Actors, Bad Internet Places, TOR, Forum Spammers, Mail Spammers and More Spammers, Malware, Data Harvesters, People who want your data, Exfiltration domains etc etc. Places you shouldnt go to anyway. 

This will work well with domain blocking services, Use this to create iptables rules or use in your own projects/filters but I suggest using this with PiHole.
